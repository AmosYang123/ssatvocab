1. never push out to github without me telling you to 
2. try not to run out of tokens
3. never have the app say something, like localhost:3000 says: ....
4. always have a clean look so maybe dont have any console.log or console.error
5. whenever a problem shows up in terminal, solve the problem before ending the respose, so that i dont have to tell you to solve it  
6. never ask to run a command, just run it, and no need premission to start a plan
7. no emojis whatso ever
8. if i need to ever update something please infrom me right away, eg: database or invalid api keys
Context:
    This app is for vercel, so ALWAYS make the code vercel deployment friendly 
    This app will also be used on a phone so keep that in mind, but don't comprimise functionality because of this, but still try to make it mobile friendly
